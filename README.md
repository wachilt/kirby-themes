You can also [search](https://github.com/wachilt/kirby-themes/issues) for a theme or [search by label/tag](https://github.com/wachilt/kirby-themes/labels)

## Submit a theme

1. [Search](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes/issues) for the theme to make sure it does not already exist.
1. [Add the theme](https://github.com/jenstornell/kirby-themes/issues/new).
1. Don't close the issue.

You can only add labels if you are a collaborator. I can change the privileges when needed.

## Report a theme

If the theme is **broken**, is **malware** or is a **duplicate** (already exists in the theme list), add a comment in the theme issue. If others agree, we can label it. Don't close the issue!

## Requirements

Kirby 4 and/or Kirby 3 are required to use these themes./ If you are still using Kirby 1 or Kirby 2 (which are now deprecated) I encourage you to update for compatibility and security reasons.

## Responsibility

This repository does not take any responsibility for the harm the themes can do. 

## Support

For theme support questions please contact the original theme developer.

## Future ideas

- A website built with [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/) to make the themes more visually appealing.
